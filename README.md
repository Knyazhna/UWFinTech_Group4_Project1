## Project Title
Real Estate Stock Analysis - 1 year 4 months

In this project we will use Polygon API keys to get the historical price data and perform quantitative analysis. Code and analysis of different graphs and visualization helps in determining which of the real estate stocks have the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, cummulative Returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios.

Application is developed through CLI which gives information about the dailyt returns, cumulative return percentage, Betas, Standard Deviation and Sharpe ratios.

## Technologies

Web Application for a Stock Analyzer project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

  [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas "Pandas") 
  
  [Polygon API](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/)

   [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila)

# Stock List and S&P 500
 AMT, CBRE, ESS, AVB, SPY

## Project Description
Build a program which analyzes the stocks of several big real estate companieS AGAINST s & p 500 FUND "SPY"

The analysis:
* Determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics:
* the daily returns, 
* standard deviations
* Sharpe ratios
* betas
* Monte Carlo Sim
* Other helpful interactive visualizations

The program will be accessed via a CLI Web Application AND we will use the Voil√† library to deploy the notebook as a web application. 


## Outline
1.) API to pull stock information into DF - Polygon.io
2.) Data cleaning/slicing
3.) Analysis
* Determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics:
